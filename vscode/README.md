# DayZ Debug Port

DayZ Debug Port is an unofficial project for DayZ modders to enable debugging outside the Workbench app that ships with DayZ tools.

## ðŸ”§ Initial setup

To have the game connect to the DayZ Debug Port, you'll need to run the **DayZDiag_x64.exe** executable instead of the vanilla **DayZ_x64.exe** binary. Once the game runs, it will auto-connect to the extension.

### Setup **Recompile on Host (Ctrl+F7)**

For **Recompile on Host (Ctrl+F7)** to work, you'll need to run **DayZDiag_x64.exe** with `-filePatching` flag and setup shortcuts from the game's installation folder to the projects to enable filePatching on as explained in [DayZ: Modding Basics - Preparing FilePatching](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/DayZ:Modding_Basics?useskin=vector#Preparing_FilePatching).

Here's an example command to create a shortcut:

`mklink /J "DayZInstallationFolder\FirstMod" "P:\FirstMod"`

**NOTE:** Recompile only reloads the code! If your recompiled code doesn't run make sure it isn't something that runs once on game startup / mission startup / player connection.

## ðŸ§© VSCode Extension

Also an output channel for the debug port logs themselves.

2. **Live Logs:** Output channel for logs from the connected game, streamed live.

3. **Code Exec**: Convenient window with script input to execute on the connected game.

4. **Recompile on Host**: Same old `Ctrl+F7` shortcut to recompile files loaded by the game. Loaded files are colored and makred with a **Z** badge beside their filename in the explorer and editor. Right click in the explorer also allows recompiling the file.
